**LLMDX: Scalable, Parameterized LLM Automation with Markdown**

LLMDX is an advanced tool for deploying and managing LLM-powered services, all configured through Markdown. With LLMDX, users can define tasks across multiple Markdown endpoints and utilize dynamic parameters to customize each LLM task, creating interactive, scalable workflows.

A single command (`llmdx -f task1.md task2.md ...`) reads multiple Markdown configuration files, launches endpoints, and connects to your LLM provider of choice. LLMDX can prompt users to complete an initial form, adapting each task based on input parameters, making it easier than ever to deploy complex, customized LLM services.

**Core Features:**
- **Markdown-Powered Configurations**: Define prompts, workflows, and task parameters in Markdown for clarity and simplicity.
- **Multi-Endpoint Support**: Simultaneously run multiple tasks with separate Markdown configurations, each representing an independent service endpoint.
- **Parameterized Task Flexibility**: Create interactive tasks with user-input forms to populate dynamic variables, supporting more adaptable workflows.
- **Easy LLM Integration**: Compatible with multiple LLM providers, offering flexibility in API choice and easy switching between services.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Deploy tasks locally or as remote services, enabling efficient management and scaling for both simple and complex LLM applications.

LLMDX combines the power of Markdown, parameterized inputs, and flexible service deployment to simplify and enhance LLM workflows, making it an ideal solution for developers and teams looking to build intelligent, dynamic LLM services.
